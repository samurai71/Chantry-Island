    Footwear suitable for hiking is mandatory. For safety reasons, Flip-Flops are not allowed.</p>

    <p>The 2 hour tour must be pre-booked and prepaid.<br>
    There are 9 seats on the boat. The cost is $30.00 per person (includes HST).<br>
    For refunds, cancellations must be received 24 hours before the scheduled departure.<br>
